<h3>Short Bio</h3>
<p>My name is Ritvik Vasan, I am a biophysics PhD from the <a href="https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/prangamani">Laboratory for Computational Cellular Mechanobiology</a> at the University of California, San Diego, advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/prangamani/group/padmini-rangamani?authuser=0">Prof. Padmini Rangamani</a>.
	I'm a </b>biophysicist</b> and </b>machine learning scientist</b>. I like to use both <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349519308215">data-driven modeling</a> and <a href="https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/full/10.1091/mbc.E18-02-0087">theoretical modeling</a> to solve complex problems. Here are press releases in - <a href="https://phys.org/news/2019-11-cell-cell-snapshots-time-lapse-videos-cells.html">phys.org</a> and <a href="http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/news/news_releases/release.sfe?id=2887">jacobsschool.ucsd.edu</a> related to one of my data-driven projects.
	I like open source tools. Checkout my <a href="https://github.com/ritvikvasan">github</a>  to see all the things that I've worked on. 
	My most <a href="https://github.com/AllenCell/serotiny">recent</a> project is a framework and set of tools to drive modular deep learning projects, currently being developed within the context machine learning projects at the Allen Institute for Cell Science. </p>
<p>Before my PhD, I obtained a B.S. degree in the Mechanical Engineering department at BITS Pilani, India in 2015. My undergraduate thesis was on implementing a low cost <a href="http://sif.sristi.org/successful-completion-of-cellphone-microscope-by-ritvik-vasan/">cellphone microscope</a> for malaria diagnosis.</p>

<h3>More about me</h3>
<p> I am a big soccer fan, competitive squash player, recreational guitarist, carnatic music singer (by training), learning salsa dancer, long distance runner, constant coffee-drinker and occasional hiker. Here's a picture of me at Cuyamaca Rancho State Park in July 2019!</p>
